# Analysis-of-energy-inefficient-buildings

Rising Prices, shrinking resources, liability for climate and environment are just a few reasons to challenge our energy consumption and approach a more thoughtful and economical way. Buildings in Switzerland are responsible for about 45 % of energy usage. EMPA would like to change this by combining open data and modern technologies like neural network classification to evaluate buildings worth a structural energy efficiency upgrade and reduce energy loss in the city Lucerne. 

This challenge is all about improving the process of analysing building structures in the city of Lucerne. Whether it is to build a solid data infrastructure, a tool for optimized data classification or an innovative analysis model, the limit is your creativity. We already developed two interesting ideas, which you can tackle or use to get you an idea what kind of puzzle pieces we are looking in the process:   

###Idea 1: 
Create a building database - To train models around the energy consumption of a building it is crucial to rely on a broad database of good quality. You build the foundation by acquiring data from Google Street View data (API) or another platform. In this process it would be interesting to see a working workflow from acquiring pictures and extracting relevant information to pool all information in an easily accessible database. Relevant information could be: “Picture of the building”, “coordinates”, “address”, “building end-use” and/or other information.

###Idea 2: 
Picture Labelling App - Neural network classification needs labelled data to train and achieve a reliable machine learning model. You could create an application prototype that will make it possible to document information and label buildings features and structures like doors, walls, etc and connect them to the physical address of the building. The following information is of special interest in this context:

- Window to wall ratio: By defining the window and door areas. It is possible to calculate the window to wall ratio.
- Building end-use: In the picture there can be seen if e.g. a restaurant is located in the building.
- Facade albedo: the colour of the building can help to determine the albedo of the build
